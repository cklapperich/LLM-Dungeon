Vitality and Conviction start at 3 for heroines, go down when they take damage.

Infamy system. Infamy may increase more/less based on the how you choose to deal with heroines - kill, impregnate, corrupt, release (+3/2/1/-1 points)

+1 bp/day, breeding is +1, intense breeding is another +1

killing or releasing are easiest options, reduce Vitality to 3 to do either.
impregnate is more difficult, takes time, heroine has chance to escape, you're doing non-combat things. Must increase Grapple state to 3.

corruption is most difficult, reduce Conviction to 3 Not all monsters can corrupt, not all can breed (most can)

Boss fight style - only ever 1 heroine / day. may have squires, servants, golems, etc [unbreedable]

Which route through the dungeon you guide the hero is always a key decision. You can lure protagonists down a certain path via various methods, some may cost resources.

higher infamy - better quality heroines

Monsters can die but you can always breed more, or possibly repair them. Maybe when a monster dies you can use its genetic material to help build new monsters.

have to breed heroines to earn breeding points plus you get a set number each day.

BACKSTORIES - GIVE GIRLS BACKSTORIES FOR FUNSIES and to make player more connected to them.

Monsters level up by gaining 'perks', not leveling. Heroines do just scale up statwise mostly. Can purchase perks. 


## PREPARATION: 
UPGRADE MONSTERS, PLACE TRAPS, PLACE MONSTERS, ADD ON TO TEMPLE

## BETWEEN COMBAT - adventurers move between rooms

## COMBAT

combat is always 1v1

Monsters can only use abilities in combat. Some grant you a free trap though.

### Grappling

Heroines that are grappled can use resist/struggle + 4 to resist grapple skill checks.

A failed grapple check from a monster decreases the stage by 1 (only if they're resisting? otherwise a failure means state remains the same? uncertain.)
Success increases stage by 1
limited use items and abilities can free from grapple/reduce stage by 1
heroines can attack or use items while grappled or abilities, instead of resisting.
many/most grapple skills give a permanent ability debuff till end of battle - to help progress things.
Need to be careful to avoid 'loop' of gameplay where you just keep going up/down by 1 grapple point. 
Healing needs to be limited. Things that reduce grapple stage carefully limited. Most grapple abilities need to come with a free +2 or +4 modifier, or a stat reduction (spider web type stuff)

Each grapple level is progressively harder to escape from. Needs a progressive modifier of some type. 1x or 2x the stage as a bonus/penalty.

healing is always limited use (very) and typically adventurers lack this

Killing an adventurer is SUPPOSED to be easier, grappling meant to be hard

Some grapple actions have a BIG bonus modifier but cause a wound, giving a tradeoff: dont want to kill

if she struggles when you choose not to grapple, thats a wasted action! Almost like a rock/paper/scissors
grapple - resist: grapple happens without modifier, failure keeps same state. Heroine gains benefit of the action
grapple + resist: grapple happens with a modifier helping the Heroine, failure on monsters grapple check reduces grapple state by 1 instead of 0
no grapple - resist action: wasted action for heroine!

[Yes exactly - if she chooses to struggle but you don't attempt to maintain/increase the grapple, her action is essentially wasted. The grapple level stays at 2 but she lost her turn. This creates interesting tactical choices - sometimes letting them waste energy struggling while you accomplish other goals can be smart!]

## breeding

breeding tradeoff - can either breed a 2nd time, or do some action to increase BP gain by +1. However monster unuseable next day.

Arousal levels for narrative purposes:
 dry - slick - sopping
maybe add gameplay implications too?

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:

Killing should be easier than capturing
Grappling should be hard but have tools to ensure progress
Avoid loops through permanent debuffs
Combat should always move toward a conclusion

## dungeons

Dungeon layout is fixed for now - limited control over it.
## Clothing/armor removal

Practical Combat-Based Removal:

Each lost point of vit loses some clothing.
Can attempt to give a command to remove clothing if its a mind control monster.
can attempt to tear clothing off a grappled heroine as an action
some monster attack abilities naturally have a shred factor (claws, dissolving slime_)
heroines can abandon an article of clothing to lower grapple level by one, if they have 1 free arm.

Gameplay Balance:

Heavy armor = better protection but grace penalty, cannot not be able to remove to slip free.
Light armor can be slipped but less protection

Different monsters specialized for different armor and character classes
