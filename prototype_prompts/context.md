# PROJECT: DUNGEON OF THE MAD GOD

## Attributes

Characters have attributes. https://gurps.fandom.com/wiki/Attributes

Might Grace  Will

From these we derive skills:

Strength
Dexterity
Intelligence
Health
Grapple[Strength]
Strong Attack[Strength]
Light Attack [Dexterity]
Ranged[Dexterity]

...and so on

HP: 2 + 1 per each 2 heatlh
Will: 5 points per 1 hp

Proficiency in a skill gives +4 modifier

Could replace HP with a wound system? HP is just # of wounds you can take?

use a simplified GURPS RPG system

Initiative is a thing and gets re-rolled every round.


Attribute Score	general meaning	details
6 or less	Crippling	An attribute this bad severely constrains a lifestyle.
7	Poor	Your limitations are immediately obvious to anyone who meets you. This is the lowest score you can have and still pass for “ablebodied.”
8 or 9	Below average	Such scores are limiting, but within the human norm. The GM may forbid attributes below 8 to active adventurers.
10	Average	Most humans get by just fine with a score of 10.
11 or 12	Above average	These scores are superior, but within the human norm
13 or 14	Exceptional	Such an attribute is immediately apparent – as bulging muscles, feline grace, witty dialog, or glowing health – to those who meet the person
15 or 16	Amazing	An attribute this high draws constant comment and probably guides the person's career choices
17 or 18.	Legendary	historical “bests” and remarkable fictional heroes
19 or 20	Mythic	astounding even among great heroes in fiction and folklore
21+	Superhuman	off-limits to humans, barely suitable for great heroes, okay for deities


Combat can end via breeding, HP reaches 0, will reaches 0, heroine or monster flees.

Combat is always 1v1.

Monsters level up via adding traits, like Feats from DND.
Player gets to choose Traits from a randomly generated list.
Monster death is permanent but you can make more. 

Heroine's have a backstory generated by LLM to get you more engaged with them. 

Heroine's have personality trits that helps the LLM determine how they react.

Combat is tuned to be short - typically 5 or so rounds. 

Everything happens via a skill check.

## GOALS:

Text-based dungeon defense RPG
Adults only, 18+
LLM is the narrator and dungeon master
Detailed descriptions of scenarios and enemy attacks
Javascript programming language

Detailed grappling system
keeps track of which limbs are restrained.
mouth can be restrained too. 

everything is data-driven, hardcode as little as possible, stored as json
## LLM Narrative Framework

Flash/4o-mini/deepseek v3 narrates everything until EXPLICIT scenes which Sonnet narrates
