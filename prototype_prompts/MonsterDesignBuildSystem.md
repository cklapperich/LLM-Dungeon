# Monster Creation & Progression System

## Core Systems

### Room Categories
Rooms have size restrictions that limit what monsters can be placed in them:
- Small Room: Can only fit Small monsters
- Medium Room: Can fit Small or Medium monsters
- Large Room: Can fit any size monster
- All combat is 1v1
- Each room holds one monster
- Dungeon layout is fixed (example: 4 small, 2 medium, 1 large room)

### Monster Sizes
Size determines base stats and slots:
- Small
  - Low base stats
  - Starting/max slots TBD through testing. Likely 1/3, 2/4, 3/5
  - Can be placed in any room
- Medium
  - Medium base stats
  - More starting/max slots
  - Requires Medium or Large room
- Large
  - High base stats
  - Most starting/max slots
  - Requires Large room

### Trait System
Traits can be:
- Active abilities (Slam, Rend, etc.)
- Passive abilities (Vitality, Speed, etc.)
- Each trait has a limited number of upgrade slots
- Players can rename and describe traits
- Traits return to gene pool when monster dies
- Cannot stack duplicate traits

## Progression Systems

### Gene Pools
1. Common Pool
   - Basic attacks (Slam, Bite)
   - Simple passives (Vitality, Speed)
   - Basic debuffs
   - 2 Daily roll from this pool

2. Capture Pool (Better Quality)
   - Status effects
   - Utility abilities
   - Stronger passives
   - 1 Roll when capturing a hero

3. Rare Pool
   - Powerful unique abilities
   - Special combinations
   - Complex effects
   - 1 roll through intense captures

### Daily Progression
- 2 free roll from common gene pool
- Capture rewards: 1 Roll from better pool
- Intense capture: 1 Roll from rare pool (monster unavailable next wave)
- Strategic choice between using monsters vs getting intense capture rewards
- there are ways to earn trait/card upgrades ala Monster Train, but not by pullin  them from packs.
- there are common/rare/legendary traits, those can then be upgraded with upgrades you unlock.
- maybe you get 1 upgrade per day or 1 upgrade per capture/intense capture?
- maybe you can choose to upgrade vs opening a pack when you capture/intense capture?

Monster cards can be upgraded up to twice, upgrading all future pulls of that monster. Or maybe monsters can be upgraded as a sort of permanent perk, or an artifact, some other progression mechanism.

Trap cards! one time use? limited use? unsure?

If a Trait card is upgraded it ONLY upgrades that exact instance of the card, though.

### Trait Upgrades
Example Upgrade Path:
```
Slam (Base):
- Deals damage based on Might

Upgrade Options:
- +2 Might modifier
- Add armor removal
- Add status effect
```

### Monster Death
When a monster dies:
- Lose the base monster
- Lose slot progression
- All traits return to gene pool
- Can reassign traits to other monsters
- need to use a new base monster card to rebuild it
- could MAYBE randomly lose traits if more challenge is needed

## Customization

### Monster Creation
Players can:
1. Choose base monster type (determines size/stats)
2. Assign traits from their gene pool
3. Name their creation
4. Write custom descriptions
5. Customize trait descriptions

### Trait Customization
- Players can rename traits
- Add custom descriptions
- LLM incorporates descriptions into battle narration
- Core mechanics remain consistent despite customization

## Strategic Elements
- Room size restrictions force diverse monster usage
- Limited trait slots encourage careful build planning
- Gene pool system makes each run unique
- Intense capture creates risk/reward decisions
- Death penalty significant but not devastating
- Customization allows creative expression while maintaining balance

## Balance Considerations
- Starting/max slots need testing
- Upgrade paths must be limited to prevent overpowering
- Room size restrictions naturally limit large monster dominance
- Gene pool quality tiers create progression
- Base stats should remain significant compared to traits

Monsters have artwork, traits have artwork

Short term: no trait upgrade system. Just pull traits from packs.

Base Monsters can be pulled from card packs.

You get X card packs per day, +Y for breeding +Z for an intense capture. Each pack is 3 cards, choose 1. 
Probably 2/day, +1 uncommon pick if capture, +1 rare pick if intense capture
