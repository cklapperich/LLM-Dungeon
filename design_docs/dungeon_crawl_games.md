Games with similar concepts to study:

Legend of Keeper - Roguelite dungeon defense where heroes come through in waves
Reverse Crawl - You play as the dungeon's monsters trying to defeat heroes
Shadow of Mordor - Nemesis system
Overwhored
SlayTheSpire

heroes return multiple times. randomly generated attributes for them.
You can kill them or breed them then let them go? then they return later?  
corrupt them and they fight for you temporarily? then they return later?

Could create multi-stage encounters where heroes retreat and return with new abilities or companions

"This structure would allow players to develop specific strategies against each hero, almost like puzzle-solving rather than just generic defense. Each hero could require different dungeon layouts, monster combinations, or trap setups to effectively counter."

"The "legendary" approach also gives you more room for storytelling and character development than an endless parade of generic adventurers would provide. Each victory against these powerful heroes would feel significant and satisfying." Legendary heroes need an escape method.

Legendary heroes stand in contrast to randomly-generated heroes as a concept.
Heroes could be randomly generated AND repeated encounters - like Shadow of Mordor - which is in opossition still to people wanting to import their favorite kinks
we could still let people swap images and descriptions!! Lol

The goal isn't to "win" each individual combat, but to gradually wear down these legendary heroes over multiple encounters, with the final confrontation being the climactic battle

we have to make sure losing to heroes doesnt 'feel bad'.  if you did well against a hero it needs to be communicated somehow and 'feel good'! If battles are short and the core gamepaly loop is understood, maybe people do feel good about getting 1-2 points of damage in.
We could ease people in with traps + a boss monster. then weaker mosnters become like, just a more cmoplicated trap

Auto battles can be optional on/off.

Short battles are definitely key - players won't feel as frustrated if each attempt is quick
Clear narrative feedback showing the cumulative damage you've done to heroes over time

The idea of only controlling the final boss fight is interesting - it would make that encounter feel special. But I wonder if players might miss out on the fun combat system

Regular monsters function semi-automatically (choose from preset behaviors)
Player directly controls special/boss monsters
Option to take manual control of any encounter for players who enjoy the tactical depth

Building anticipation for the final confrontation (or breeding) after seeing heroes gradually weakened to create satisfying payoff moment. Players would feel like they earned that victory through persistent effort.

Each point of damage/corruption generates some resource that you can use (but what...? another card draw maybe? damage to draw cards?)

probably only large/boss-ish monsters can breed a hero
medium monsters can be like the minotaur - sexual things like facefucking them but no breeding
small critters are just foreplay
"bad things" can still happen pre-breeding and pre final monster encounter! arousal drugs, corruption, covered in semen, clothes torn, weakened bound or exhausted.
Need a 'reward screen' and a litte happy success noise when you 'lose'

Peons mean your monsters need to balance killing peons / combat ability with their abiltiy to corrupt/breed
