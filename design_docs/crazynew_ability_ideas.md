# New Combat Mechanics

ORTHOGONAL DESIGN GOOD. LINEAR DESIGN BAD. THINGS THAT GIVE +X TO A STAT ARE BOORRING.

## Monster Special Abilities
- **Lair Action**: Once per combat, a monster can trigger a room-specific effect (traps, hazards, etc.)
- **Legendary Presence**: A legendary monster ability that forces heroes to face them alone (peons run away in fear upon reaching the room)
- **Intimidate** (Monster): Force target to make a Might vs Will save or they must retreat to previous room (delays hero progress)

## Last Stand Mechanics
- **Desperate Fury**: When at 1 Vitality, gain +2 to all attacks
- **Final Defiance**: When you would take your final wound, ignore it and gain +3 to your next action (then take the wound)

## Reacting to hero abilities
but what abilities do heroes have? generally just attack, inflict a status, resist/struggle, or escape. maybe they need more unique abilities.
- **Protective Stance** Sacrifice your next action to gain +2 to all defenses until your next turn
- **Interrupt resist** - if the hero is about to breakfree, priority interrupt + deal some status/damage as a bonus
- **Interrupt attack** - if the hero is about to attack, priority interrupt + deal some status/damage as a bonus

## Resource Management
- **Vitality Surge**: Spend 1 Vitality to add +3 to one roll (attack or defense)
- **Corruption Embrace**: Hero can voluntarily take 1 Corruption to get more damage or a bonus to a roll
- maybe rooms themselves have 'resources' that you can 'spend'. YOu can add/remove water/light as a 'cost' to use an ability.

## Gambling Mechanics - good.
- **Reckless Attack**: +3 hit but defender gets +3 on their next action against you
- **Desperate Strike**: +3 hit but if you miss, you're prone
- **Overexertion**: Take 1 wound. All ability effects apply twice die if target defends sucessfully

## Combo Abilities
- **Follow Through** (Rare): If your previous action inflicted a status effect, this attack gets some bonus or extra effect
- **Chain Reaction** (Legendary): If you've inflicted 2+ different status effects on target, this attack deals 2 wounds and clears all statuses

## **Deathrattle / Battlecry** (Monster): When defeated, inflict 1 corruption or wound on your killer
- on death, inflict 1 corruption or wound on your killer
- Return to hand with X vitalty when die
- revive another monster when die
- revive self after X turns when die (regrowth/crysalis type thing). possibly with a stat boost!
- generate trap when die
- generate trap card when played
- generate monster card when die / when played
- cause light/darkness when played in room/when die

## Psionic
monster can always see next player action

## Ambush 
- Get a free round if you pass a stealth check! may require certain room environment types or conditions.

## Abilities

### Change path / teleport abilities
**Lure Retreat** - special ability, a monster acn use wit or will to end the battle and lure the protagonist down a specific path
**Mage teleport** - instant escape if it works, and they teleport 2 rooms ahead with an initiative loss?
**rogue slip past** - move to next room, end battle
**push back** - force heroine into the previous room, end battle. if a monster or trap is in the previous room it re-triggers. 

### Environmental & Structural Abilities for Monsters to interact with Rooms
- **Cave In** - block off an entire portion of the dungeon. can only be used on an 'intersection' node. Forces the heroine to take the other path.
- **Destroy Light Source** - darkness, monster OR hero can get a benefit if they have darkvision!
- **Avian Perches and ledges** - can be an advantage for monsters with wings or climbing! but disadvantage: pillar/perch can be destroyed? or only ranged attacks from a perch?
- **Structural Damage** - monsters can attack some element in the room itself
- **Water Features** - monsters can drown a heroine while grappling? use the water to change how their abilities work somehow?
- **Use secret passage** - Small monsters can slip between rooms/branches if placed in certain rooms
