# should skills be removed?

monsters/players have attributes
skills have attributes
abiilities have skills

Right now they let us:
    - modify or disable entire categories of abilities
    - fallback narrative descriptions of abilities that dont have a description provided

we could:

- have narrative descriptions for the 4 attributes instead
- rely more on descriptions for each ability
- defense options could be attributes instead of skills
- uncertain how much value narrative skill descriptions add to the game.
