# Body Parts

slimes are immune to bodypart restrictions?
bodyparts+size determine monster stats?
a monster can equip 1 core ability per bodypart.
plus a preparation/deathrattle/ambush ability, with 2 for medium and 1 of each for large critters

## Flexibility & Theming

Allow renaming/reflavoring of all abilities
Generic bodypart names with examples (Venom Delivery, Grappling Appendage)
Themed synergy cards that provide strategic options rather than static bonuses
Ensure themed decks remain viable while maintaining mechanical distinctiveness
