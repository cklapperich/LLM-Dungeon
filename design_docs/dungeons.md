# Reverse Dungeon Crawler Game Concept

## Core Mechanics
- dungeons are randomly generated gauntlets for each run (not player-built dungeons)
- Monster and traps placed in rooms by player based on strategy
- there can be branches, and secret passages between branches
- Turn-based 1v1 combat with LLM narration
- Monsters and traps have unique abilities and traits, are handcrafted by the player or picked from premade packs

## Dungeon Generation
- Phase 1: prebuilt dungeons with prebuilt rooms. 
- Phase 2: random dungeons with pregenerated rooms.
- Phase 3: random dungeons layout but with player-generated rooms drawn from their deck.

## Balance Mechanisms
- Dynamic gauntlet effects (modifiers that change each run giving buffs/debuffs to certain strategies)
- Hero resistances and unique abilities (forcing adaptation)
- Monsters heal 1 wound between *waves.* All status clears between waves for monsters.
- Heroes heal 1 wound between fights..? maybe? armor repair abilities are more exclusive.
- Can only play the monsters you draw
- size limit on rooms
- dungeons that prevent certain mechanics or allow new mechanics
- dungeons can have 'themes'. Then the hero can be purposely built to match the theme?

## Progression
- Rewards based on hero damage / corruption level / # of breedings - even if you lose the run you get rewards!
- usually 1 hero/wave. Heroes are big bad bosses. Initially 1 wave/day. Advance to 1hero + X peons/wave, more waves, then eventually 2 or 3 heroes might be reasonable.
