# Monster Creation & Progression System

## Core Systems

## Monster Attributes
- Body parts (defining primary abilities they can equip?)
- Size class (Small/Medium/Large worth 1/2/3 points)
- preferred biomes?

## Strategic Elements
- Room size restrictions force diverse monster usage
- Limited trait slots encourage careful monster planning
- Intense capture creates risk/reward decisions
- Customization allows creative expression while maintaining balance
- 'trap specialist' monsters that add a trap to your deck
- monsters that add monsterlings to your deck
- monsters that add monsters to your deck when they breed
- dead monsters dont go back into your deck right away? or they do but you do have to draw them again?
