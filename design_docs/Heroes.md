Ccome in difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard?)


Hero's are generally weak to:

- A specific attribute: might, grace, will or wit based abilities
- A specific damage type: corruption, wound, or grappling
- A specific status ailment(s)

- Rogues are lightly armored, high Grace, pgood vs traps, good vs grace grappless, usually alone, 
can slip past monsters without fighting them, can inflict poison and other status ailments on monsters

- Mages are light armor spell abilities, low might, medium Will, wit based

- priestess - will based, light armor, can heal selves, can inflict 'purity' damage to defeat a mosnteR? can turn a monster against you?

- Fighters are heavily armored/clothed, might based, low Will high Vitality/Might

## Armor tradeoff:

heavy armor makes you resistant to penetration but weak to grace-based grappling? grace penalty in general?
