# LLM Dungeon

## Create Any Monster you can dream of
Create your own monsters. Give them backstories. Tragic pasts. Describe their vicious claws and teeth in detail. Rename and re-describe every ability in the game.
Watch as the LLM narrates every round of combat and works your descriptions into the narrative.
Choose from a wide array of body parts and randomly-drawn abilities.

## Defend your monsters home

Place your monsters into LLM-generated dungeons.
Make clever use of terrain: light, chasms, pools of water, collapsible pillars.

## Gripping, LLM-narrated combat

Combat that flows together like a george RR martin novel: each round builds off the story of the previous round, creating a cohesive narrative.

## Grow

Defeat heroes, and grow bigger badder better monsters. Repeat.
