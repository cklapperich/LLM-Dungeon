Each attribute ranges from 3-18, with 10 being average human:

Grace: Agility and coordination
Mind: Intelligence and perception
Will: Mental fortitude and force of personality

14-17: Exceptional - immediately apparent quality
18+: Legendary - historical "bests" and heroes

## Skill Checks

Roll 3d6 and try to roll UNDER your attribute
Modifiers affect the attribute, not the roll
Critical success on natural 3-4
Critical failure on natural 17-18

Difficulty Modifiers
Apply these to the effective attribute:

Easy: +4
Normal: +0
Hard: -4
Very Hard: -8

## Opposed Checks
Both parties roll 3d6:

Each must roll under their modified attribute to succeed
If one succeeds and one fails, success wins
If both succeed or both fail, compare margin of success/failure
Ties go to the defender

## Combat
Physical Combat

Attacker rolls against Might (melee) or Grace (ranged)
Defender's armor subtracts from attacker's effective attribute
Success = one Wound
Critical success = two Wounds

## Mental Combat

Attacker rolls against Mind
Defender's Will acts as "mental armor"
Success = one Mental Strain
Critical success = two Strain

Wounds & Mental Strain

Physical Wounds

Maximum wounds based on Might:

Might 6 or less: 1 wound
Might 7-9: 2 wounds
Might 10-13: 3 wounds
Might 14-17: 4 wounds
Might 18+: 5 wounds

At maximum wounds, character is dead

## Mental Strain

Will 6 or less: 1 strain
Will 7-9: 2 strain
Will 10-13: 3 strain
Will 14-17: 4 strain
