# Reverse Dungeon Crawler Game Concept

## Core Mechanics
- Pre-generated random gauntlets for each run (not player-built dungeons)
- Monster placement in rooms based on strategy
- Turn-based 1v1 combat with LLM narration
- No permanent monster death between runs


## Synergy Systems
- Room-based synergies (monsters perform differently based on room type)
- Adjacent room synergies (monsters interact with nearby monsters)
- Status effect synergies (monsters that capitalize on specific status effects)

## Balance Mechanisms
- Dynamic gauntlet effects (modifiers that change each run giving buffs/debuffs to certain strategies)
- Hero resistances and unique abilities (forcing adaptation)
- Monsters heal 1 wound between *waves.* All status clears between waves.
- Heroes heal 1 wound between fights.  
 Possible ideas for future consideration:
  * Limits on size, bodyparts, etc.
  * Random subset of collection available each run
  * gauntlets that limit you to a specific type of monster
  * gauntlets that limit to a certain size

## Progression
- Rewards based on hero damage/defeat
- Unlock new monsters and abilities over time

## Secret Passages
Small monsters can slip between rooms/branches if placed in certain rooms
