# Dungeon Trap System

## Core Mechanics

### Trap Basics
- Traps are cards drawn from gene pools (similar to monster traits)
- Placed in designated trap zones (quantity determined by dungeon design)
- Cannot be placed in monster rooms
- One trap per trap zone
- Immovable once placed (can be replaced but original trap is lost)
- Trigger once per wave (usually, sometimes more)
- Traps placed near compatible monster receives bonus modifier
- Traps need to have a modifier: +4 is typical for common traps. +4 for rare traps that wound/corrupt, otherwise +8. +8 typical for legendary traps.

### Trap Lifecycle
- **Triggered Trap**: Returns to gene pool after combat
- **Disarmed/Disabled Trap**: Permanently removed from gene pool
- **Replaced Trap**: Permanently removed from gene pool

### Placement Limitations
- Only in designated trap zones in corridors
- Cannot be moved once placed
- No trap size system initially

## Trap Rarity Tiers

### Common Traps
- Available in daily common gene pool rolls
- Basic damage and simple effects
- Lower risk for permanent loss

### Uncommon Traps
- Available in capture pool
- Can apply 1 wound or corrupt 1 conviction
- More significant attribute modifications

### Rare Traps
- Available in rare gene pool (intense captures)
- Mechanically unique effects that can change encounter dynamics
- High opportunity cost (vs. rare monster trait)

### Core Trap Effects
- **Wounds**: Physical injuries that persist until healed (3 leads to defeat)
- **Corruption**: Reduces conviction resource (0 conviction = retreat)
- **Attribute Modifiers**: Permanent adjustments to hero attributes
- **Status Conditions**: Various effects based on game design (not specifically enumerated)

### Trap Generation Abilities
- Certain monsters/traits can grant additional traps:
  - +1 trap when the monster is drafted
  - +1 trap per wave (renewable resource)

### Trap Synergy System

### Trap vs. Monster Investment
- Traps offer frontline defense before hero reaches monsters
- One-time use but potentially powerful effect
- Opportunity cost: trap gene vs. monster trait gene

### Potential Additions
- Trap upgrades (similar to trait upgrades)
- Trap specialist monsters that enhance nearby traps
