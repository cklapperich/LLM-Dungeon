## Attributes and Skills

Characters have four attributes:
- Might
- Grace
- Will
- Wit

From these we derive skills. Each skill is based on an attribute, for example:
- Grapple[Might]
- Light Weapons[Grace]
- Heavy Weapons[Might]
- Perception[Wit]

Proficiency in a skill gives +4 modifier.

Attribute Score meanings:
6 or less: Crippling
7: Poor
8 or 9: Below average
10: Average (most humans)
11 or 12: Above average
13 or 14: Exceptional
15 or 16: Amazing
17 or 18: Legendary
19 or 20: Mythic
21+: Superhuman

Initiative is 3d6-grace, lowest wins, rerolled each round.

## Vitality and Conviction

Typical vitality values:
- Size 1 creatures: 1-2 vitality
- Size 2 creatures and Heroines: 3 vitality
- Size 3 creatures: 3-5 vitality

Heroines start with 3 conviction (more for high will ones).

Vitality and Conviction go down when taking damage.

## Infamy System

Infamy may increase more/less based on how you choose to deal with heroines:
- Kill: +3 points
- Impregnate: +2 points
- Corrupt: +1 point
- Release: -1 points

Killing or releasing are easiest options, reduce Vitality to 3 to do either.
Impregnate is more difficult, takes time, heroine has chance to escape, you're doing non-combat things. Must increase Grapple state to 3.
Corruption is most difficult, reduce Conviction to 3. Not all monsters can corrupt, not all can breed (most can).

Higher infamy means better quality heroines.

## Combat Structure

Boss fight style - only ever 1 heroine / day. May have squires, servants, golems, etc [unbreedable]

Which route through the dungeon you guide the hero is always a key decision. You can lure protagonists down a certain path via various methods, some may cost resources.

Monsters can die but you can always make more through card packs.

BACKSTORIES - GIVE GIRLS BACKSTORIES FOR FUNSIES and to make player more connected to them.

Monsters level up by gaining 'perks', not leveling. Heroines do just scale up statwise mostly. Can purchase perks. 

Built in default abilities: slam/bite, grapple, remove clothing (only grappled target). These are all +0 and built into all monsters.

## PREPARATION: 
UPGRADE MONSTERS, PLACE TRAPS, PLACE MONSTERS, Slot Traits into Monsters

## BETWEEN COMBAT - adventurers move between rooms

### COMBAT

Combat is always 1v1

Monsters and heroes can only use activity abilities (traits) in combat. Some traits are active some are passive.

### Traits

Pulled from card packs. 
Common/rare/legendary
Cooldowns: abilities have cooldowns by default its 0.
give passives or new attacks.
Can be upgraded over time.

### Breeding

See grappling.md

## Arousal System

heat/arousal levels:
0 1 2 3
dry - slick - sopping - in heat
-0/-1/-2/-3 to grapple/breed checks.


## Status
Prone lasts 1 turn, is -2 might vs Grapple and -2 Grace, cant stack.

## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:

Healing is always limited use and typically adventurers lack this

Many/most grapple skills give a permanent ability debuff till end of battle - to help progress things.
Need to be careful to avoid 'loop' of gameplay where you just keep going up/down by 1 grapple point. 
Some monsters are pure combat, some are pure breeding.
An ability with a high hit modifier that only deals a wound might be balanced - most players want to breed their monsters. Not kill.
An ability with a wound an an extra effect could be balanced - the wound is often seen as a downside.
An ability with a strong debuff and a high modifier ("powerful web spit attack") would probably be very strong, maybe too strong unless as a legendary rarity ability.
abilities that just wound or just deal a permanent -1 or -2 to a certain stat are common.
abilities that just knock prone are common.

Command - Breed: A Grapple[wit] vs wit check that increases breeding progression by 1. rare b/c uniqueness. +0.

Killing an adventurer is SUPPOSED to be easier, breed/corrupt meant to be hard
Grappling should be hard but have tools to ensure progress
Avoid loops through permanent debuffs
Combat should always move toward a conclusion
Create meaningful choices ALWAYS

Rare abilities are not just stronger but also more unique mechanically.

Restraints need to give a penalty to grapple checks. 

Each grapple level should give an additional -1 to checks? maybe?

Each restrained limb gives -1 to Grapple[Might] and Grapple[Dex] checks.
Resistance is 1 less effective each use, resets after the combat encounter.

## wounds

Wounds give -1 might each. Gives some incentive to deal them.


## conviction

Like Vitality but different. 
Every lost point of conviction from max is -1 to Will and -1 to grapple. Low reward for doing it once. Big reward for getting it down to 0. 

At Conviction 0:

All Will-based Commands auto-succeed
All grapple attempts auto-succeed
Might Grace and Wit all get halved (rounded down!), minimum 4. 

## Dungeons

Dungeon layout is fixed for now - limited control over it.

## Clothing/armor removal

Simply an integer. Armor increases the integer. Abilities can decrease it.
breed has a  max clothing level that will work.
mind control to command an adventurer to strip, acid or rending attacks, 
adventurers can strip an article of clothing to remove a level of grapple with no check. They lose the item from inventory AND 1 clothing level,
and lose the benefits of the armor too.

Typical is: chestplate, leggings, clothing. Each gives +1. Clothing gives no combat benefits but is a layer of protection from breeding.
Mages can get 2 clothing levels from robes.
Rogues probably have 3 from light armor.
Fighters maybe have 4 typically to start with.
