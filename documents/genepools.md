### Gene Pools
1. Common Pool
   - Basic attacks (Slam, Bite)
   - Simple passives (Vitality, Speed)
   - Basic debuffs
   - 2 Daily roll from this pool

2. Capture Pool (Better Quality)
   - Status effects
   - Utility abilities
   - Stronger passives
   - 1 Roll when capturing a hero

3. Rare Pool
   - Powerful unique abilities
   - Special combinations
   - Complex effects
   - 1 roll through intense captures

### Daily Progression
- 2 free roll from common gene pool
- Capture rewards: 1 Roll from better pool
- Intense capture: 1 Roll from rare pool (monster unavailable next wave)
- Strategic choice between using monsters vs getting intense capture rewards
- there are ways to earn trait/card upgrades ala Monster Train, but not by pullin  them from packs.
- there are common/rare/legendary traits, those can then be upgraded with upgrades you unlock.
- maybe you get 1 upgrade per day or 1 upgrade per capture/intense capture?
- maybe you can choose to upgrade vs opening a pack when you capture/intense capture?

Monster cards can be upgraded up to twice, upgrading all future pulls of that monster. Or maybe monsters can be upgraded as a sort of permanent perk, or an artifact, some other progression mechanism.

Trap cards! one time use? limited use? unsure?

If a Trait card is upgraded it ONLY upgrades that exact instance of the card, though.

### Trait Upgrades

```
