# Monster Creation & Progression System

## Core Systems

## Monster Attributes
- Body parts (defining primary abilities they can equip?)
- Size class (Small/Medium/Large worth 1/2/3 points)
- preferred biomes?

## Strategic Elements
- Room size restrictions force diverse monster usage
- Limited trait slots encourage careful monster planning
- Intense capture creates risk/reward decisions
- Customization allows creative expression while maintaining balance
- 'trap specialist' monsters that add a trap to your deck
- monsters that add monsterlings to your deck
- monsters that add monsters to your deck when they breed
- dead monsters dont go back into your deck right away? or they do but you do have to draw them again?

### Monster Sizes
Size determines base stats and slots:
- Small
  - Low base stats
  - Low slots
  - Can be placed in any room
- Medium
  - Medium base stats
  - More slots
  - Requires Medium or Large room
- Large
  - High base stats
  - Most slots
  - Requires Large room

### Trait System
Traits can be:
- Active abilities (Slam, Rend, etc.)
- Passive abilities (Vitality, Speed, etc.)
- Each trait has a limited number of upgrade slots
- Players can rename and describe traits
- Traits return to gene pool when monster dies
- Cannot stack duplicate traits

## Progression Systems


### Monster Death
When a monster dies:
- Lose the base monster
- Lose slot progression
- All traits return to gene pool
- Can reassign traits to other monsters
- need to use a new base monster card to rebuild it
- could MAYBE randomly lose traits if more challenge is needed

## Customization

### Monster Creation
Players can:
1. Choose base monster type (determines size/stats)
2. Assign traits from their gene pool
3. Name their creation
4. Write custom descriptions
5. Customize trait descriptions

### Trait Customization
- Players can rename traits
- Add custom descriptions
- LLM incorporates descriptions into battle narration
- Core mechanics remain consistent despite customization

## Balance Considerations
- Room size restrictions naturally limit large monster dominance
- Gene pool quality tiers create progression
- Base stats should remain significant compared to traits

Short term: no trait upgrade system. Just pull traits from packs.

Base Monsters can be pulled from card packs.
