## Clothing
Clothing has a level (0-5) armor adds to your level.
By default a heroine has a clothing level of 1 with no armor.
Breeding requires a clothing level of 0, some active or passive traits may allow breeding at 1 or even higher clothing.

## Grappling Rules

Normal progression is grappled-\>penetrated-\>win combat
If you use penetrate while the heroine is already penetrated, you breed & win combat. She's too exhausted to continue.
all hero non-break free non-item actions take a -2 penalty.

**Point Buy Info**  
\- A penetration costs \-1 for each requirement it has  
\- A grapple costs \-1 for each requirement it has  
\- Bind and restrain limb cost 1 less on a grapple

**Grab Ability Guidelines:**  
- Grabs always start at Cooldown(1) to stop repeated attempts with the same grab.

**Penetration Ability Guidelines:**   
\- -2 hit modifier by default.
\- Tentacles and Ovipositor penetration usually works at 0-1 clothing.   
\- Most penetrations require require prone & 0 clothing  
\- Slime Tentacles usually work at 0-2 clothing.  
\- Ghosts work at 0-5 clothing.  
\- Oral penetrations work at 0-4 clothing, generally requiring mouth \+ both arms bound.  
\- Penetrate+Finish as one action is a Legendary, costs 4 points  
\- Require 2 uses to win combat.
\- Legendary: \-1 use for \-4 points  
\- Rare: \+1 use for \-4 points

**BREAK FREE / SLIP FREE**  
Each use applies exhaustion, \-1 to breakfree/slipfree for rest of combat, max exhaustion \-4
breaking free undoes all limbs bound since the grapple started and removes the grappled state.
Each grappled limb is a -2 to break free

If you are penetrated and break free - you go back to grappled and free 1 random limb if applicable.

1\) Hero chooses Break Free/Slip Free, monster chooses a grapple or a penetrate: character gets \+4 to roll

- success: Removes penetration, if not penetrated escapes the grapple  
- Fail: grapple/penetration succeeds

2\) Hero chooses resist, monster does something else: Wasted hero action\! No roll for resistance\!  
3\) Hero chooses punch/kick/item/stab/bite, monster chooses grapple/penetrate:  

### Items to break free
Limited use items and abilities can reduce stage by 1 or reduce back to 0.
Heroines can use abilities or items while grappled or abilities, instead of resisting.

If she struggles when you choose not to grapple, thats a wasted action! Almost like a rock/paper/scissors

## intense breeding
breed twice, twice the reward, lose the monster for the next wave
A penetrate ability requires as description of the 'intense' stage for the LLM to narrate.'
