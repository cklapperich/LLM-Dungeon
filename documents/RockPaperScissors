Simplified RPS Cycle

| Hero Action      | Monster Action      | Outcome                                   |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Break Free       | Grapple/Penetrate   | Hero advantage (+4)                       |
| Break Free       | Other Action        | Monster advantage (hero wastes action)    |
| Attack           | Either type         | Neutral (standard resolution)             |
| Defensive Stance | Grapple/Penetrate   | Monster advantage (hero's defense wasted) |
| Defensive Stance | Other Action        | Hero advantage (reduced effect)           |

priority beats defensive stance - comes out first.

corruption -> low will
grappling --> low might usually, low grace sometimes?
wounding --> low might, usually? low grace sometimes

grace based abilities --> warriors, mages
might based abilities--> mages
will based abilities --> warriors
